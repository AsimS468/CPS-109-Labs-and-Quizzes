    if items contains three elements, and they're all the same,

    LOOPING IS NOT REQUIRED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM!

    FOOD FOR THOUGHT:    
    This function should work on all three 
    sequence types we've seen - strings, lists, and tuples. 
    Do you have to do anything different for the different types, 
    or can your code be exactly the same regardless of the 
    sequence type? This is a VERY powerful notion in computer 
    science that you will explore further in future courses.

# 3) Inversions of Three
# --------------------------------------------------------------
def inversions(items):

    '''
    Like the previous question, you may assume 'items' 
    is a sequence. Also like the previous question, it should
    not matter if items is a string, list, or tuple.
    
    If items does not contain exactly three elements,
    return the integer -1.
    
    If items contains exactly three values, return the number
    of inversions in the sequence.
    
    In a sequence, an 'inversion' is a pair of elements that 
    are out of order with respect to the sorted sequence.
    We will consider 'sorted' to mean ascending order.
    
    For example:
    
    The list [1, 2, 3] contains zero inversions, because 
    the list is in ascending order.
    
    The list [2, 1, 3] contains one inversion, because the
    2 and the 1 are out of order with respect to each other.
    
    The list [3, 2, 1] contains THREE inversions. The 3 is 
    out of order with respect to both 2 and 1 (two inversions)
    and the 2 is out of order with respect to 1 (one more inversion)
    for a total of three inversions. 
    
    For an added challenge, try solving this problem using as few
    comparisons (<, >, <=, >=) as possible.
    
    LOOPING IS NOT REQUIRED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM!

    FOOD FOR THOUGHT:    
    Once you've solved this problem, think about how your code 
    would have to change if there were four elements, five elements, 
    six elements, etc. Notice how the complexity grows. 
    How many more comparisons would you need for four elements? 
    Five elements? 100 elements? 
    What is the relationship between the number of comparisons
    and the number of elements in the sequence? This is another 
    supremely important notion that we'll explore further towards
    the end of the course, and in future courses.

    if len(items) != 3:
        return -1

    a, b, c = items
    numOfInversions = 0

    if a > b:
        numOfInversions += 1
    if a > c:

# 4) Increasing, Strictly or Otherwise?
# --------------------------------------------------------------   
def increasing(items, strict):   
    
    '''
    Once more, assume items is a sequence. The second parameter,
    'strict', is boolean (True or False)
    
    If items does not contain exactly three elements,
    return the string 'invalid input'
    
    If 'strict' is something other than True or False, 
    return the string 'invalid input'
    
    If the sequence contains three elements, we now want to
    determine if it is ascending. However, there's a twist - we
    will distinguish between ascending, and strictly ascending.
    
    If a sequence is ascending, every element is greater than 
    or equal to the one that came before it.
    
    If a sequence is strictly ascending, every element is 
    strictly greater than the one that came before it.
    
    If parameter 'strict' is True, you should test for
    strictly ascending. If it is False, check for simple
    ascending.
    
    In either case, return True if the 'items' is ascending,
    strict or otherwise, and False if not.
